Hello there, I am Piyush from Jamnagar, Gujarat, INDIA. A cybersecurity student curious to explore the unknowns. Stay updated and find real and legit content on this blog of mine, related to cyber-security and personal learnings.

## Background

I am from a lower-middle class, typical Indian family. An ambivert and straightforward. I like to explore and learn cybersecurity on a daily basis and sometimes write blogs. Currently enrolled in BCA (Bachelor of Computer Applications, 1st Year).

Except cybersecurity, I like **psychology**, **criminology**, **travelling**, **spiritual readings** and **PC Games**.
